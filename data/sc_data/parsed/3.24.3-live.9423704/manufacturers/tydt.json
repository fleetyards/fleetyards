  "description": "Tyler Design & Tech began its life manufacturing generators, air purifiers, and other necessities for planetary settlers. Tyler focused on making products that, while not as powerful as some other brands, were durable and extremely efficient with little heat byproduct which led to the development of low-signature power plants.  It wasn’t long before even the UEE Navy began to outfit some of their own stealth crafts with Tyler parts, and with their new success the company was able to expand their ship component line into what it is today."
