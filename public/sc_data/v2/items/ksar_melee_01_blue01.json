The blade embodies Kastak Arms' aggressive styling and was designed to stab, slice, or saw. It features a strong tip for piercing, a straight edge for slicing, and a unique serrated edge with microblades for when you really need to rip through something. The blade is also made with a special ceramic polymer coating that enhances its strength and overall wear resistance. For the special Squall edition, a light blue color was added to the coating to make it even more visually distinct.",
