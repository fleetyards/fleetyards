  "description": "When Humanity started being attacked by Vanduul, it was often those who lived in the border system who suffered the most. Believing that civilian defensive components were not up to facing this deadly enemy, Gorgon Defender Industries, founded by former inhabitants of Caliban, was established to take military strength products and deliver it the population at large so they could properly protect themselves. With the strength of their designs, Gorgon earned a reputation that soon caught the eye of the military."
