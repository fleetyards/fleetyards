  "Description": "Exchanging gilded red envelopes is one of the most popular ways of celebrating Red Festival. Often the envelope may include a small amount of credits inside to help those you care about have a strong start in the upcoming cycle. Growing in popularity is the newer tradition of hiding the envelopes as a way of spreading good fortune and prosperity to those that fate has deemed in need.Â \n\nStow the envelope as a token of luck, share it with a friend or loved one to spread good fortune, or exchange it at a commodities terminal and use the credits for a prosperous beginning to a new cycle.",
