# Frontend Styling Rules

## SCSS Usage
- Use SCSS for all custom styles.
- Organize styles by feature/component in the appropriate directory (e.g., `shared/components/ComponentName/index.scss`).
- Use variables and mixins for colors, spacing, and reusable patterns (see `stylesheets/variables.scss`).

## Naming Conventions
- Use BEM or similar methodology for class names to avoid conflicts.
- Use lowercase and dashes for class names (e.g., `.primary-action-btn`).

## Imports
- Import global variables and mixins at the top of each SCSS file as needed.
- Avoid deep selector nesting; keep specificity low.

## Best Practices
- Prefer utility classes for layout and spacing when possible.
- Use CSS custom properties for themeable values if needed.
- Remove unused styles regularly.

## Bootstrap
- Use Bootstrap utility classes where possible to reduce custom CSS.
- Override Bootstrap variables in `variables.scss` for project-wide changes.
