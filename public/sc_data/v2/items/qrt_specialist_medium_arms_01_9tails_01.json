Blending durability and a striking style, the Artimex armor exemplifies the Quirinus aesthetic. This intricately detailed armor considers both form and function, especially when paired with the fully enclosed helmet that features a neon ocular flourish. The armor also comes with a unique cowl that fans over the helmet and a knee length fitted cape.",
