  "description": "The Behring Research Consortium was founded in 2554 on Terra as the end result of several years of buyouts and consolidation of dozens of small research and development firms by Behring Equity Investments. By having so many different research units focusing on a wide variety of developments, the Behring group hoped to increase the likelihood of expensive research resulting in a marketable product. Their history speaks for itself as the famed laboratory is accredited for the standardization of laser weaponry and dozens of other innovations. Today, Behring is still going strong with their technological forward products featuring straight forward and simple designs, making everything from guns, missiles, sentry drones, to shields and armor."
