  "Name": "Tevarin War Service Marker (Worn)",
  "Description": "A service marker awarded by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) to all members of the military who served during the First Tevarin War. Though many were produced in their time, those numbers have dwindled significantly and collectors are eager to pick up any found. This marker is considered in worn condition due to the corroded state of the metal and etchings."
