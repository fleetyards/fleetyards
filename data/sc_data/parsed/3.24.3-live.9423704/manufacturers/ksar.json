  "description": "Kastak Arms makes inexpensive energy weapons with intimidating names like Devastator and Firestorm, and aggressively markets them to distressed parts of the Empire. Even though the company portrays itself as providing weapons for personal defense, the brand has become more readily identified with people who use them for aggressive and unlawful purposes."
