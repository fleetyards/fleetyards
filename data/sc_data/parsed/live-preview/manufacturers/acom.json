  "description": "In racing circles, the term ACOM has come to have two meanings. The first is an abbreviation of the phrase ‘a commanding lead’ – meaning to pull so far ahead that the rest of the pack doesn’t stand a chance of catching up. The second is a more recent usage in that it refers to the start-up manufacturing company who took the phrase as their epithet. ACOM focuses on creating ship components that handle as much power as possible as quickly as possible in order to give pilots the all-important extra edge during a race. Founded by the children of famed pit crew chief Garrit Bijarani, siblings Jayce and Zan took four generations of racing knowledge and gave it form in ACOM’s full line of power plants and coolers."
