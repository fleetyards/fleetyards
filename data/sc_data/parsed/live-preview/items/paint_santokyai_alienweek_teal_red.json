  "description": "The Ocellus livery adapts and updates the iconic colors and design used on some Tevarin ships to bring a striking new look to the San'tok.yāi. The livery adds a distinct red pattern to the fuselage while shimmering green covers the rest of the ship. Grey lines swoop across the entire ship to help break up its silhouette.",
