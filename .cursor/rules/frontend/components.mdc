# Shared Components Directory (`app/frontend/shared/components`)

This directory contains reusable Vue components used throughout the Fleetyards frontend. Components here should be:
- Generic, composable, and not tightly coupled to a specific page or feature
- Well-typed with TypeScript
- Styled using SCSS (with BEM or similar conventions)
- Documented and tested where appropriate

## Structure & Conventions
- Each component lives in its own directory (PascalCase or descriptive name)
- Main entry: `index.vue` (with optional `index.scss`, `types.ts`, and tests)
- Subcomponents or helpers go in subdirectories
- Use `<script setup lang="ts">` and `<style lang="scss" scoped>`
- Add a `README.md` or comment block for complex components

## Adding New Components
- Use a new directory for each major component
- Include `index.vue`, `index.scss`, and `types.ts` as needed
- Write unit tests (`index.test.ts`) for logic-heavy components
- Follow naming and structure conventions
- Update this file with a short description

## Best Practices
- Keep components focused and small
- Use props and emits with full TypeScript typing
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Document any non-obvious logic

This file should be updated whenever new shared components are added or conventions change.
