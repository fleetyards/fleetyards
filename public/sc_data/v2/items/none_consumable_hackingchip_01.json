  "Description": "This powerful cryptokey is considered to be one of the highest caliber hacking tools available. Long rumored to have been originally designed for Advocacy use, these difficult to acquire devices have only recently been making its way into the hands of criminals. Most who have used them say they are worth the effort to acquire.
