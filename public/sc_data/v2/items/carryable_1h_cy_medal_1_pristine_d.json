  "Name": "Government Cartography Agency Medal (Pristine)",
  "Description": "This medal was awarded by United Planets of Earth (UPE) to members of the Government Cartography Agency who flew or supported missions involving the discovery, exploration, or scanning of new systems. It features a star woven with one large and three smaller interlocking circles that was the central symbol on the UPE flag. The exquisite state of the ribbon and metal has left this one in pristine condition."
