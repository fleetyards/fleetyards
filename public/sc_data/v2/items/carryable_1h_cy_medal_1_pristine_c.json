  "Name": "Tevarin War Service Marker (Pristine)",
  "Description": "A service marker awarded by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) to all members of the military who served during the First Tevarin War. Though many were produced in their time, those numbers have dwindled significantly and collectors are eager to pick up any found. Well-preserved despite its age, this marker is considered in pristine condition and features clean etchings and minimal wear.  "
