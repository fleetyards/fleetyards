  "description": "Soft drinks, high end kitchen equipment, children’s toys? Sakura Sun. Rover platforms, terraforming solutions, bioengineered livestock? Sakura Sun. High-tech wave cannons, starship power plants, antimatter ordinance? Sakura Sun! While corporate conglomerates are not uncommon, it’s rare for any company to advertise them all under the same banner. But at Sakura Sun, empire-building is in full effect: you’ll find a little bit of everything branded with a distinctive purple sun-and-cherry-blossom logo, from plastic Hi-Ho Flatcat figurines to top-of-the-line multi-particle/wave cannons. Stranger still, Sakura Sun has successfully gained a reputation as a company that not only does a little bit of everything, but does it well."
