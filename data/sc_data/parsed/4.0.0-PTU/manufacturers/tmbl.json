  "description": "Tumbril Land Systems got its start manufacturing ultra-rugged land vehicles built to explore the strange and dangerous landscapes of newly discovered planets. With the onset of the First Tevarin War, Tumbril expanded their operations when they won a government contract to build tanks and other military vehicles for the UPE military. Over the centuries the company eventually folded. Today, the Tumbril brand has been revived to build land vehicles from tanks to exploration vehicles and personal HOVs in both the civilian and military market."
