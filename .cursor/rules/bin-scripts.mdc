# Bin Scripts and Development Workflow

This document provides an overview of the development scripts available in the `bin` directory and how to use them for various development tasks within the Fleetyards application.

## Development Environment Setup

### Primary Development Scripts

1. **`bin/dev`**
   - **Purpose**: Starts the local development environment
   - **When to use**: For running Rails, Sidekiq, and Vite locally
   - **Implementation**: Uses `foreman` to run processes defined in `Procfile.dev`:
     - `web`: Rails server
     - `worker`: Sidekiq background job processing
     - `vite`: Vite development server for frontend assets

2. **`bin/dev-docker`**
   - **Purpose**: Starts the complete development environment with Docker services
   - **When to use**: For running all services in Docker containers
   - **Implementation**: Uses `foreman` to run processes defined in `Procfile.docker.dev`:
     - `web`: Rails server
     - `worker`: Sidekiq background job processing
     - `vite`: Vite development server
     - `docker-compose`: Runs supporting services (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)

3. **Other scripts**
   - `bin/setup`: Sets up the application for development
   - `bin/rails`, `bin/rake`: Standard Rails commands
   - `bin/sidekiq`: Starts Sidekiq for background jobs
   - `bin/vite`: Runs the Vite build/dev server
   - `bin/rubocop`: Runs Rubocop for Ruby linting

Refer to each script for more details and available options.
