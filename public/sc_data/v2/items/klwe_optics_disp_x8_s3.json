  "Description": "Manufacturer: Klaus & Werner\nType: Monitor\nAttachment Point: Optic \nMagnification: 8x\nSize: 3\n\nWhile conventional scopes can induce eyestrain after extended periods of use, the Touchstone 8x monitor from Klaus & Werner provides ultra-critical eye relief and allows for “heads up” shooting where you are able to simultaneously track targets and observe environmental conditions. Built to cater to a variety of shooters, the Touchstone's reliability and clarity makes it the ideal choice for tactical rifles like the Arrowhead.",
