  "Description": "Generally found in shallow waters in the temperate regions of Locke, this species of fish feeds on waste and algae that collects at the bottom of rivers. The tentacles allow the fish to sift through the loose rock and soil. Though technically edible, most avoid eating them because they taste pretty terrible.",
