  "description": "For civilians, Anvil Aerospace produces small fighting craft but with less of the pirate stigma. These ships are more expensive, less spit-and-glue, and built to take more hits than a comparable Drake model. The bulk of Anvil's income is from its military contracts with the UEE to design and build their warships, especially the iconic Hornet."
