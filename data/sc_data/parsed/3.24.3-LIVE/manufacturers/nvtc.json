  "description": "High-end company known for manufacturing technically precise and experimental optics and weapon attachments. Founded in 2811, NV-TAC initially built sensors for long-range scanning stations and surveying operations before shifting operations to the more profitable personal weapon market. Seen by some as too expensive and feature-dense, but beloved by soldiers and security professionals for their durable design, precision adjustments, and reliable performance."
