  "description": "The Ocellus livery adapts and updates the iconic colors and design used on some Tevarin ships to bring a striking new look to the Defender. The livery gives the fuselage a prominent red section while shimmering green covers the rest of the ship. Thick grey lines swoop through both colors to provide a unique geometric pattern.",
