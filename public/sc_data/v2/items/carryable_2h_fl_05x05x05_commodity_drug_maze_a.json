  "Description": "Street name for a tranquilizer and knock-out hallucinogen that's Tevarin in origin. Dosing up is like taking a massive journey into your own mind. To the outside world, you’re nearly comatose, but to you, it’s a wild trip. A handful of religions have been started after a user took a trip into the maze. Aside from the toxic element, there’s a chance you won’t come down from the high. They call this ‘getting disconnected.’ Users stay locked in their own head until their brain decays. Maze was originally used as a near religious experience for Tevarin warriors to find their path in life. Since the fall of the Tevarin empire, it's become corrupted into a purely recreational drug. The Tevarin who once treated this drug with reverence and ritual, now make boatloads of credits selling it to anyone who wants to risk a potentially dangerous trip.",
