  "Description": "Item Type: Medium Armor\nDamage Reduction: 30%\nTemp. Rating: -52 / 82 Â°C\n\nSometimes all you gotta do is put on the right piece of armor to make your message loud and clear. Clash armor first started popping up when the Dredge got strong-armed into mass-producing their armor and it's been scaring everyone stupid since. Now everybody's stealing it. Clash features a reinforced medium plating to get you a good balance of protection without giving up too much speed.",
