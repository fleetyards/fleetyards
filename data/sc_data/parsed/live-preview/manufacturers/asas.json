  "description": "Ascension Astro started off as a boutique specialty company; selling high-end, low IR thrusters to wealthy clients who wanted to fly their luxury ships while avoiding the eyes of greedy pirates. As good as their thrusters were at being low-sig, the effect was often ruined when the engines or shielding made by other manufacturers would be screaming the shipâ€™s presence. Slowly, Ascension began expanding their line to include a whole suite of components that, when working in conjunction, would provide an extremely low profile and a safer journey."
