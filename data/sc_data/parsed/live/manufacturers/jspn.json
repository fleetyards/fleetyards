  "description": "J-Span does only one thing, but does it well. For over a century they have focused on producing quality coolers at a reasonable price. Half the time these days, when you pop the hull of a spacecraft, chances are you’re going to find a J-Span. Plus, their coolers can be found in more than just ships. They have a wide variety of sizes and shapes that can be found in everything from land transports, to computer systems, to refrigerator units. Appealing to the broader consumer market, their units might not have all the bells and whistles as some of the other manufacturer’s lines, but for the most part they avoid their quirks as well."
