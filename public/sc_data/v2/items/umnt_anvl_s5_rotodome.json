  "Description": "Manufacturer: WillsOp\nItem Type: Radar\nSize: 5\n\nWhen the UEEN came to Anvil needing a ship to handle mobile C&C, Anvil turned to WillsOp, one of the most trusted names in scanning and deep-space radar. Together they developed the Long Look Radar (LLR) system as a way to upgrade the modern Hornets rather than developing an entirely new ship. Fully loaded with WillsOpâ€™s suite of scan systems, the LLR now brings its raw analytical power to the civilian market, turning an already dependable vessel into a perfect scanning fighter.",
